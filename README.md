## Contributing in Github
1. Create your branch:
- In a terminal (IDE, Terminal, etc.), go to the github repo folder. In our case, `travel-plan`.
- Checkout to your target branch (the branch you want to merge your changes to): `git checkout <target_branch>` (e.g. `master`)
- Ensure you have the latest changes: `git pull`
- Create your own branch: `git checkout -b <your_branch_name>` 
   > branch naming convention: <your_name>/<branch_purpose> (e.g. sh/update-readme)
2. Make changes based on the ticket/task's requirement.
- Sanity Check <br/>
  Ensure existing features in the target branch works, then ensure your changes work as expected. 
- Tests <br/>
  Due to time constraint, we plan to write tests after the main features being functional. For the time being, <b>we require every pull request to have a proof of concept screenshot, or it's not eligible for approval.</b>
3. Commit your changes (can leverage IDE or `git commit -a -m "msg"` too)
- `git add .` 
- `git commit -m "commit message that describe your changes"`
- `git pull`: to handle potential merge conflicts
- `git push`
    > Potential problems: too many to list, general rule of thumbs is to read the error message and follow its instruction. Reach out if unable to resolve it.
4. Create your pull request
- Go to [repo's main page](https://github.com/hu38/travel-plan), click on `Pull requests`
- Attach your screenshot(s) to the description
- Either wait or ask someone to review/approve your code.
  > When you have time, it's always good to review others' pull requests.
- Done!
